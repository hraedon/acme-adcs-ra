# Live re-proof runbook (WI-038)

**Why this exists.** Cloud CI **cannot reach an ADCS CA**, so a green CI run does
**not** confirm that the enrollment and revocation legs still work — those depend
on a real CA, a domain-joined RA host, and a passwordless gMSA. This runbook is
the repeatable procedure for proving the ADCS integration end-to-end, plus the
cadence at which it must be run so "proven" does not decay silently.

> **Green CI ≠ ADCS-verified.** CI (lint + type + Python unit + Pester
> pure-logic + identifier-gate + pip-audit) proves the code and the operator
> scripts' *logic*. It does not prove issuance or CA-side revocation. Only this
> live re-proof does.

## Cadence (when to run it)

Run the full live re-proof:

1. **At every release** (before tagging), on the exact commit being shipped.
2. **Before any production pilot.**
3. **On a fixed interval while deployed** (recommended: quarterly) — a rot check
   against ADCS/OS/template drift the monthly Python rot-canary can't see.
4. **After any change to the issuance leg** (the standing project rule).

Record each run in the validation log in
[`pre-pilot-checklist.md`](pre-pilot-checklist.md).

## Prerequisites

- The deployed build on the RA host is the commit under test (`pip install
  --force-reinstall` the wheel into the app-pool venv; **deploy the entire
  `scripts/` directory including `scripts/lib/`** — the officer/registration
  scripts dot-source `scripts/lib/`).
- Access to the CA host (to provision/verify officer rights) and the RA host.
- A throwaway EAB credential + admin token in the RA dotenv (removed at teardown).

## Procedure

### A. Issuance + EKU (shared leg)

1. Start the RA app pool; confirm `GET /directory` → 200.
2. Drive a full ACME round-trip (new-account EAB → order → challenge → finalize →
   cert). Confirm: serverAuth-only EKU (WI-026 passes on a real cert),
   `clientAuth` absent, chain off the existing CA (no new intermediate), SAN from
   the CSR, requester = the enrollment gMSA in the CA DB.
   **Also confirm the chain check did not false-reject** (2026-08-11): the RA now
   requires a certificate in `certnew.p7b` to both match the leaf's issuer *and*
   verify its signature. A successful issuance is the proof — a validator that is
   subtly wrong breaks *every* issuance, and no unit test can show that because
   only the real CA produces the real chain.
3. Provoke a policy denial (out-of-scope SAN) → rejected at finalize.
4. Confirm reason-7 revocation is rejected (`badRevocationReason`).

### A.1 ACME front controls (added 2026-08-11)

These are cheap (no CA involvement) and belong in every run — they are the
controls a *deployment* mistake silently disables, which unit tests cannot see.

1. **URL binding pins to `base_url`, not the request.** With the site binding
   left catch-all (the installer default), send a `newAccount` whose JWS `url`
   and `Host:` header both name some other hostname → **rejected**, `url host
   mismatch … expected <base_url host>`. Then send a well-formed request whose
   *EAB only* names another deployment → **rejected**,
   `badExternalAccountBinding`. Then a `kid` naming another deployment →
   **rejected**, `not an account URL on this server`.
   *Why here:* a proxy or binding change can make `request.url` and `base_url`
   disagree; this is where that shows up.
2. **Account eviction — with the control first.** Rename the allowlisted kid in
   the dotenv, recycle the pool, then:
   - **control:** a *new* account under the renamed kid must **succeed** (201).
     Without this the next two steps pass trivially if the dotenv failed to
     parse. (PowerShell 5.1's `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` writes a BOM that
     breaks it — write UTF-8 without BOM via
     `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($p, $txt, (New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding($false)))`.)
   - the pre-existing account: `newOrder` → **401**, and `revokeCert` → **401**.
     The revoke case is the one that regressed silently before.
3. **Deactivation** (RFC 8555 §7.3.6): POST `{"status":"deactivated"}` to the
   account URL → 200; the next request from that account → **401**.
4. **Resource URLs resolve:** POST-as-GET the order `Location`, the account URL
   and the account's `orders` link → all 200. POST-as-GET another account's
   certificate → **401**.
5. **Nothing extra is published:** `/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json` → **404**.
6. **Nonce ceiling:** ~220 rapid `HEAD /acme/new-nonce` → a mix of 204 and
   **429** with `Retry-After`.

### B. Automated revocation — two-identity (recommended topology)

1. Provision a dedicated revoker gMSA on a utility host: grant it
   **Certificate Manager (`0x2`, not Manage-CA)** on the CA security descriptor,
   apply the template-scoped `OfficerRights` (`Set-OfficerRights.ps1`), add
   `Certificate Service DCOM Access`, and confirm it belongs to **no** broader
   certificate-manager group (union-semantics constraint).
2. Register `Sync-Revocations.ps1` as a scheduled task **under the revoker gMSA**
   (`Register-MaintenanceTasks.ps1 -RegisterRevocationSync`, no `-LocalMode`,
   `-RequesterName <DOMAIN>\<enrollment-gMSA>$`).
3. Revoke a test cert in the RA (`revokeCert`), run the task, and confirm the
   round-trip: CA DB disposition = Revoked, RA pending set drains to empty,
   `ca_crl_updated=true`.
4. **Compromise independence:** confirm the **enrollment gMSA holds no officer
   rights** (its SID absent from the CA security descriptor's manager ACEs;
   `GetMyRoles` shows Enroll only).

### C. Automated revocation — single-identity (opt-in variant)

Same as B, but the enrollment gMSA itself holds the template-scoped officer
rights and the task runs on the RA host with `-LocalMode`. Confirm the
least-privilege bound holds: with the default (no `-PublishCrl`), the officer
revokes and confirms but the inline CRL republish is **denied** (needs Manage-CA);
the revocation appears at the next scheduled CRL publication.

### D. Enrollment-side bound (E-1)

Confirm the enrollment gMSA can enroll **only** `ACME-ServerAuth`, not `Machine`:
inspect the gMSA's live token (no `Machine`-enroll principal, e.g. Domain
Computers) and confirm issuance still works. See
[`revocation-scope-validation.md`](revocation-scope-validation.md) Finding E-1.

### E. Teardown (return to pristine)

Remove the `OfficerRights` value and restore the CA security descriptor to its
original bytes (back them up first); delete any test revoker gMSA + its CA grant;
unregister the scheduled tasks; restore the RA store DB + dotenv (removing the
throwaway EAB + admin token); stop the app pool if the deployment is parked.
Leave the CA and RA exactly as found. **Do not** revert the E-1 remediation (the
enrollment gMSA's restricted primary group is a permanent hardening, not a test
artifact).

**Preserve the post-run store BEFORE restoring it.** Copy the live store — all
three SQLite files, and only after the app pool is confirmed *stopped* — to a
dated directory that the restore does not touch, and fail the teardown if that
copy cannot be made rather than proceeding. Do it before removing anything, so a
failure costs a re-run and not the evidence.

This is not housekeeping. WI-052 went four rounds unresolved while the data that
would have settled it was generated by every session and deleted by this step:
the store carried `crl_this_update` on every CRL-verified confirmation, and 722
audit rows spanning two months contained not one of them. The item was not
un-measured, it was **un-measurable** — and the same is true of *any* property
that needs evidence from more than one session. A restore-to-pristine teardown
is correct for isolation and is amnesia for measurement; keeping one dated copy
per session costs almost nothing and is what makes the class measurable at all.

Anything you intend to measure *across* sessions must live outside the restore
scope entirely — see `scripts/sample_crl_age.py`, which needs no RA at all.

**Reference implementation of the preserve step.** The prose above is the
policy; this is the code, committed here so that anyone re-proving from a
clean checkout re-applies the change by paste instead of re-deriving it. It is
identifier-free and parameterised (`$StateRoot`, `$Python`); the live copy in
the gitignored harness (`samples/lab-harness/restore.ps1` in this checkout) is
the authoritative one, and the two must not drift. Load-bearing semantics:

- it runs **only after the app pool is confirmed stopped** (copying a store a
  live writer still holds is what corrupted the 2026-08-14 run);
- it copies **all three SQLite files** — a `.db` without its `-wal` is missing
  the newest commits, which are precisely the rows the session was run to
  produce — plus the SIEM mirror;
- it **throws before anything is removed**, so a failure to preserve leaves
  the post-run store intact on disk and the teardown re-runnable.

```powershell
# PRESERVE THE POST-RUN STORE BEFORE DESTROYING IT (UNFILED item 22).
$postrun = Join-Path $StateRoot ("postrun-store-" + (Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss'))
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $postrun | Out-Null
$preserved = 0
foreach ($suffix in @('', '-wal', '-shm')) {
    $src = Join-Path $StateRoot ('acme_ra.db' + $suffix)
    if (Test-Path $src) {
        Copy-Item $src (Join-Path $postrun ('acme_ra.db' + $suffix)) -Force
        $preserved++
    }
}
if ($preserved -eq 0) { throw "no post-run store found at $StateRoot to preserve; refusing to restore over an unexamined state" }
if (-not (Test-Path (Join-Path $postrun 'acme_ra.db'))) { throw "preserved $preserved file(s) but not acme_ra.db itself; refusing to proceed" }
Copy-Item (Join-Path $StateRoot 'acme_ra.siem.jsonl') (Join-Path $postrun 'acme_ra.siem.jsonl') -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# Row counts, not file size: "the store was preserved" is the kind of claim
# whose failure mode is silence, and a byte count would not distinguish a
# session's worth of audit rows from an empty schema.
& $Python -c "import sqlite3,json,sys;c=sqlite3.connect(sys.argv[1]);print('POSTRUN-PRESERVED '+json.dumps({t:c.execute('select count(*) from '+t).fetchone()[0] for t in ['audit_log','certificates','orders']}))" (Join-Path $postrun 'acme_ra.db')
Write-Output ("POSTRUN-STORE=" + $postrun)
```

Treat `POSTRUN-PRESERVED {…}` and `POSTRUN-STORE=…` in the teardown output as
required evidence of the preserve step; their absence means the teardown ran
without it and the session's longitudinal evidence was destroyed.

## The lab-specific half of this procedure

This document is deliberately placeholder-only: it says *what* must be proven.
The *how* for a given lab — hosts, credentials, the automated harness, and the
tricks for provoking paths a well-behaved CA will not hand you (a policy denial,
both transport-orphan branches, a failed confirmation) — belongs in a gitignored
companion, because it names real infrastructure. In this checkout that is
`samples/lab-validation-runbook.md`, with the harness itself at
`samples/lab-harness/`. If you are re-proving in a different estate, write the
equivalent for yours rather than putting identifiers here.

## Environment gotchas (observed)

- **gMSA scheduled tasks** need `LogonType=Password` (a gMSA never logs on
  interactively). `Register-MaintenanceTasks.ps1` sets this.
- **`certutil` argument order:** `-config` must precede the `-revoke`/`-CRL` verb.
- **CA-side officer provisioning** must ship `scripts/lib/` alongside the scripts.
- **Create the revoker gMSA with explicit AES Kerberos etypes.** A gMSA created
  without `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` set gets **RC4** added to its supported
  etypes; if the DCs block RC4 (common hardening), the account's Kerberos context
  fails (`Install`/`Test-ADServiceAccount` → *"the provided context did not match
  the target"*) and its managed password is unusable on members. Create it with
  `New-ADServiceAccount … -KerberosEncryptionType AES128,AES256` (or set
  `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes = 24` after the fact). Symptom is easy to
  misread as a KDS/time-sync problem — it is not.
- **`certutil` does not echo the `-restrict` clause** (verified 2026-08-11). A
  serial with no matching row returns `Maximum Row Index: 0` / `0 Rows` with the
  serial *absent* from the output, so `Confirm-SerialAtCa`'s "does this serial
  exist" grep is sound rather than vacuous. Re-check this if the CA's OS or
  locale ever changes — the whole WI-022 requester guard sits behind it.
- **Serial form: the CA stores the padded byte string.** The RA emits
  `format(n,'x')`, which never has a leading zero, so a certificate whose
  high-order byte is `0x0N` would not match an exact `-restrict` lookup.
  `Get-CaSerialForm` re-pads to even length; `Revoke-Cert.ps1` dot-sources
  `scripts/lib/RevocationLib.ps1` for it. If a revoke exits 4 on a serial the RA
  says is pending, check this first.
- **The revoker needs its own readable copy of the scripts.** In the two-identity
  topology the revoker runs on a separate utility host with its own
  `scripts/` (+ `scripts/lib/`); if you co-locate it on the RA host for a test,
  the revoker gMSA has no ACL on the RA's locked-down `C:\ProgramData\acme-adcs-ra\`
  — stage a copy it can read/execute and point `-ScriptDir` at it.
