# Architecture & security model

The design spine. Everything downstream (the ACME server, the enrollment leg, the
policy) derives from the decisions here.

## The RA model (why no intermediate, no signing key)

acme-adcs-ra is a **Registration Authority**, not a CA. It authenticates and
authorizes certificate requests, then **forwards the CSR to the existing ADCS
issuing CA**, which signs with its existing key and chain. The RA holds no
signing key. Consequences:

- **No new intermediate / no parallel trust.** Certs come off the chain already
  distributed to every domain-joined machine.
- **The blast radius of compromising the RA is bounded by its enrollment
  rights**, not by possession of a CA key. That is why the template scope (below)
  is the load-bearing control.

## Component flow

```
Certify the Web ──ACME (RFC 8555)──▶ acme-adcs-ra ──/certsrv/ POST (Negotiate)──▶ ADCS CA ──▶ cert
        │                  EAB-gated         │  runs as gMSA (passwordless)            signs
        └──────────────── returns the ADCS-issued cert + existing chain ◀────────────────────┘
```

## ACME server responsibilities (RFC 8555 subset)

The minimum to serve an enterprise client:
- `directory`, `newNonce`, `newAccount` (JWS account-key verification) **with EAB**,
  `newOrder`, authorizations + challenge handling, `finalize` (accept the CSR),
  `certificate` retrieval, `revokeCert`, `keyChange`.
- **Resource reads (added 2026-08-11).** Account-scoped `POST`-as-`GET`
  (RFC 8555 §6.3, empty-string payload) for the order (`/acme/order/{id}` — the
  `Location` newOrder returns and the URL a conforming client polls), the
  account (`/acme/acct/{id}`), the account's order list, the authorization and
  the certificate. Account deactivation (§7.3.6) is a `status` change POSTed to
  the account URL. Unauthenticated `GET` remains available for the certificate
  and authorization for compatibility with the clients this RA was proven
  against; conforming clients should use the POST forms, which are
  account-scoped and therefore not an existence oracle.
- **URL binding is against configuration.** Every JWS — and the EAB binding —
  must name the URL derived from the configured `base_url`, never the URL the
  request happened to arrive on. `base_url` is therefore load-bearing security
  configuration, not a display value.
- Trust model is **enterprise identity, not public domain control**: EAB binds the
  ACME account to an enterprise-issued credential; the network allowlist bounds
  who can reach the endpoint. (Challenge handling still runs per the RFC; EAB is
  the *who-is-allowed* gate, not the challenge.) An account is usable only while
  its `status` is `valid` **and** its EAB kid is still in the allowlist — both
  re-checked on every authenticated request, so pulling a kid is a complete
  eviction rather than an issuance-only block.

## Enrollment leg (RA → ADCS)

- Submit the CSR to `/certsrv/certfnsh.asp` with **SPNEGO/Negotiate + channel
  binding** (RFC 5929 `tls-server-end-point`, via the in-tree
  `negotiate_auth.NegotiateAuth` over `pyspnego`), authenticated as the service's
  ambient **gMSA** identity — no stored password. Channel binding is what lets it
  work against `/certsrv/` hardened with **EPA=Require** (the secure setting).
- The **certificate template** governs validity, EKU, key rules, and subject
  handling. The RA does not set validity; the template does.
- **Reference implementation (read, do not depend on):** acme2certifier's
  `mscertsrv` CA handler in `auth_method=gssapi` mode is a working model of this
  exact call. We reuse the *approach*, not the package.
- Transport modes A and C differ only in *where* `/certsrv/` lives and whether
  Kerberos delegation is required — see `certsrv-setup.md`. The ACME server side
  is identical across modes.
- **Redirects are refused outright.** `requests` strips the `Authorization`
  header when a redirect crosses hosts, but that protection does not reach this
  path: `NegotiateAuth` sets no static header, it registers a *response hook*
  that fires on any 401 and mints a fresh Kerberos token. A redirect to a host
  answering `401 Negotiate` would therefore draw a freshly minted gMSA ticket
  out of the RA — channel-bound to the real CA's certificate, so relayable.
  Nothing in `/certsrv/` legitimately redirects, since every URL is built from
  the configured host, so refusing costs nothing. Enforced in the session
  factory rather than per call site.
- **The CA call runs on a worker thread.** The finalize handler is `async def`,
  which FastAPI runs on the event loop rather than in its threadpool, so a
  synchronous multi-second CA round-trip inline would stall every other request
  in the process. The supported deployment is a single process, so nothing else
  absorbs it.
- **Single-backend CBT assumption (WI-006):** the channel-binding token is
  derived from a side-channel TLS probe of the `/certsrv/` host. This is correct
  for Mode A (one CA host) and single-host Mode C. If `/certsrv/` is fronted by
  **NLB/ARR** with multiple backends, the probe and the enrollment connection may
  see different certificates, so EPA=Require rejects the channel-bound token
  (fail-closed). Multi-backend topologies are unsupported without reworking the
  CBT derivation — see `negotiate_auth.NegotiateAuth`.

## Security model

- **Server-authentication-only template, subject/SAN from the CSR.** Scoping the
  EKU to server-auth bounds a compromise to spoofing internal TLS services and
  keeps it short of client-auth / PKINIT (domain takeover). SAN-supply on a
  server-auth-only template is a categorically smaller risk than on an
  any-purpose or client-auth template.
- **One hardened gMSA chokepoint.** ADFS/Exchange need SAN certs; *something* must
  hold SAN-capable enrollment. Concentrating it in one audited, single-purpose,
  tier-0-adjacent identity reduces attack surface vs. distributing the right to
  every app server — and yields a complete, monitorable issuance record.
  **Condition:** the RA host/identity must be hardened *beyond* the app servers it
  replaces, or it is merely a single high-value target.
- **The RA's gMSA + template is itself an ESC surface.** adcs-lens would analyze
  it. Keep Enroll rights minimal and the template free of requester-supplied
  client-auth EKUs.
- **Gating:** EAB credential pinned to the authorized ACME client (Certify the
  Web) + network/IP allowlist at the reverse proxy.

## Certificate lifecycle states

A certificate row in the RA store is in exactly one of three states, and the
distinction is load-bearing rather than bookkeeping:

| State | Meaning | Served to a client? |
|---|---|---|
| `valid` | Issued by the CA and honoured by the RA | Yes |
| `revoked` | A client asked for it back | No — `410 Gone` |
| `quarantined` | The CA issued it; a post-issuance verifier rejected it | **Never** |

**Quarantine exists because rejection happens too late to prevent issuance.** By
the time the SAN, EKU, and CA-capability verifiers run, ADCS has already signed:
the certificate has a serial, sits in the CA database, and is trusted
domain-wide. Recording nothing — the pre-v1.9 behaviour — left a live
certificate the RA had just refused to honour with no serial anywhere in the
RA's own records, and therefore invisible to its revocation workflow.

**The same window opens on failure, not just on rejection.** `certfnsh.asp`
returns an "issued" disposition with a ReqID *before* the RA fetches the leaf,
fetches the PKCS#7 chain, and checks that the chain binds to the leaf. A failure
in any of those steps is equally a live certificate at the CA, so it quarantines
by the same route. Where the failure came before the leaf arrived, there are no
bytes to store — the store keys on them — so the ReqID is made loud in the audit
row and the log instead, and the operator revokes by ReqID at the CA by hand.
That asymmetry is deliberate: it is better to be explicit that the RA cannot
clean this one up itself than to record a row it cannot act on.

A quarantined row is recorded with its serial, ReqID, bytes, and the violations;
its order goes terminal-`invalid` so a retried finalize cannot reach a serve
path; and it is **queued for CA-side revocation through the ordinary pull-agent
loop** rather than a bespoke mechanism. "Never served" is enforced in the
response builder itself, not left to each caller to remember.

## Audit model

Every issuance is recorded in **two independent places**: the RA's own SQLite
store (request, account, SANs, template, outcome) and the **ADCS CA database**
(with requester = the gMSA). The RA **emits** each issuance to SIEM, reusing
cert-watch's export pattern — satisfying "an audit trail for every cert."

Three properties make that claim hold rather than merely state it:

- **The certificate row and its audit row commit in one transaction.** They used
  to be independent commits, so a fault between them could leave a stored,
  serveable certificate with zero `certificate-issued` events — precisely the
  silent issuance the rule exists to prevent. SIEM fan-out happens *after* the
  commit and stays fail-open: the durable record is the local row.
- **The off-box requirement asserts the constructed emitter, not the configured
  sink name.** An emitter that disabled itself (empty syslog host, an unusable
  HEC URL or token) previously let the app start while the operator believed the
  off-box gate was satisfied and the only evidence lived on the host an attacker
  is assumed to control. The RA now refuses to start.
- **The in-memory delivery queue is bounded.** A slow or unreachable HEC
  endpoint could otherwise let unauthenticated, request-driven audit events
  accumulate without limit on an issuance-path host. Overflow drops from the HEC
  sink only — never from the audit table — and is counted and logged.

## Trusting a CA-side revocation

The RA holds no CA rights, so it cannot ask the CA "did you revoke this?". The
pull agent runs `certutil -revoke` and then tells the RA it succeeded. Two
things keep that from being a bare act of faith:

- **Separated authority.** Confirming a revocation asserts an external security
  event the RA did not observe, so it takes a dedicated credential
  (`ACME_RA_REVOCATION_CONFIRM_TOKEN`) and **refuses the general admin token**.
  While the two were shared, any admin-token holder could drop a still-valid
  certificate off the retry queue and leave a success audit behind. An unset
  confirm token disables the endpoint rather than falling back.
- **Optional independent evidence.** A CRL is published by the CA, signed by the
  CA's own key, and readable without privilege — the one check available to the
  RA that does not rest on the calling agent's honesty. With
  `ACME_RA_REVOCATION_CONFIRM_CRL_URL` set, the RA verifies the CRL's signature
  against the issuing CA certificate **taken from the certificate's own stored
  chain**, and records `verification: "crl-verified"` or `"agent-asserted"`
  accordingly. The audit trail never implies the RA saw more than it did.

  Two properties make that check mean what it says. **Freshness is verified
  separately from the signature**, because a signed CRL verifies for ever:
  `nextUpdate` must be present and future, `thisUpdate` must not be future, and
  an absolute age ceiling bounds staleness independently of `nextUpdate`, which
  the CA chooses. And **the issuer is selected by signature, not by name** — a
  CA key renewal keeps the subject DN and changes the key, so name-matching
  picks the wrong generation from a chain holding both.

- **Publication is reported separately from revocation.** `ca_crl_updated` means
  the CA revoked; `crl_published` means the CRL was actually republished. On the
  default least-privilege path the officer *cannot* republish (that needs
  Manage-CA), so the normal case is revoked-but-not-yet-published — during which
  relying parties still accept the certificate. Collapsing the two would let a
  field named `ca_crl_updated` imply a publication that was deliberately
  skipped.

## Credentials

EAB MAC keys and the admin/confirm tokens are validated at config load, which is
the only place that sees them before they become load-bearing: MAC keys must be
valid base64url decoding to ≥ 32 bytes, tokens ≥ 32 characters. These floors
accept everything `scripts/eab.py` generates and reject hand-typed values.
A MAC key decoding to *zero* bytes was previously treated as a present key,
which let anyone who knew the kid forge the binding with an empty HMAC key —
an authentication bypass, not merely a weak credential.

## Deliberate deviation from the family

The read-only / air-gapped / flag-don't-probe conventions that govern cert-watch
and adcs-lens **do not apply** — this system writes to the world (it causes
issuance) and holds a standing identity. The compensating disciplines are the
hard rules in `AGENTS.md`: no signing key, deterministic policy, passwordless,
least-privilege template, audit-everything.
