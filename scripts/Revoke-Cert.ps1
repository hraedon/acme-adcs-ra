.SYNOPSIS
    Revoke a certificate at the ADCS CA out-of-band (WI-010), with a
    requester check (WI-022) that refuses to revoke certs not issued by the
    expected enrollment identity.

.DESCRIPTION
    acme-adcs-ra's `revokeCert` endpoint records the revocation in the RA store
    only -- it does NOT write the CA CRL, because the RA's gMSA intentionally
    holds no CA-officer ("Manage CA") rights (the project's tightest security
    tenet; see docs/threat-model.md section E). This script is the operator-run,
    CA-officer credential that performs the actual `certutil -revoke` against
    the CA, closing the loop the RA started.

    Run this as a CA officer (NOT the gMSA, NOT the RA host service account)
    from a management host that has RSAT / certutil available and line-of-sight
    to the CA. The serial or ReqID it consumes is exactly what the RA already
    stores and surfaces in its audit log and `revokeCert` response
    (`details.serial`, `details.req_id`, and the `out_of_band_revocation` hint).

    The script:
      1. Confirms the cert exists at the CA (by serial or ReqID) before
         revoking, so a typo cannot silently no-op. Confirmation is
         locale-independent: it matches the hex serial value (which is always
         hex regardless of OS locale), not a localized column header. It then
         asserts the CA-DB `Request.RequesterName` equals -RequesterName
         (default the enrollment gMSA), refusing to revoke a cert not issued by
         the expected identity (WI-022 -- defense-in-depth before the CA-side
         officer restriction; the requester value is a SID/name string, not a
         localized header, so the check is locale-independent).
      2. Maps the RFC 8555 reason code (0-10) to the `certutil -revoke`
         reason code (0=unspecified, 1=compromised, 2=CA compromise,
         3=affiliation changed, 4=superseded, 5=cessation of operation,
         6=certificate hold, 8=remove from CRL, 9=privilege withdrawn,
         10=AA compromise). Reason 7 is unused in RFC 5280 and is rejected.
      3. Runs `certutil -revoke <serial> <reason> -config <CA>` and prints the
         outcome.
      4. Re-publishes the CRL so the revocation is visible without waiting for
         the next scheduled publication (`certutil -CRL republish -config <CA>`).

    This is a documented, auditable operator action -- the RA's audit log
    records `revocation_scope=ra-store-only, ca_crl_updated=false` and this
    script's invocation (with the operator identity in the CA database) is the
    matching out-of-band half. Keep both records together in incident review.

    Exit codes:
      0  = success
      3  = validation error (bad params, invalid reason)
      4  = cert not found at the CA (serial or ReqID does not resolve)
      5  = requester mismatch (cert was not issued by the expected enrollment
           identity -- WI-022)
      6  = already revoked at the CA; no CA-side change was made. NOT a failure:
           the CA state is what was wanted. Sync-Revocations.ps1 treats this as
           "retry the RA confirmation", which is what makes a dropped callback
           recoverable instead of permanent (2026-08-17 F4).
      N  = certutil exit code (transport / CA-side failure)

.PARAMETER Serial
    The certificate serial number (uppercase hex, no `0x` prefix) as the RA
    stores it (e.g. `1A2B3C...`). Use this when you have the RA's
    `details.serial`.

.PARAMETER ReqID
    The ADCS request ID (decimal) as the RA stores it (e.g. `42`). Use this
    when you have the RA's `details.req_id`. The script looks up the serial
    from the CA database via `certutil -view` and then revokes by serial
    (`certutil -revoke` accepts serials only). Either -Serial or -ReqID is
    required; -Serial wins if both are given.

.PARAMETER CaConfig
    The CA configuration string (`CA01\WORK-DOMAIN-CA` form). Required --
    certutil needs it to address the CA. Use the placeholder form in committed
    samples; the real value lives in gitignored local config.

.PARAMETER Reason
    RFC 8555 revocation reason code (0-10). Default 0 (unspecified).

.PARAMETER RequesterName
    The expected enrollment identity (the gMSA that enrolls via the RA), in
    `DOMAIN\account` form. The script asserts the CA-DB
    `Request.RequesterName` of the target cert matches this value before
    revoking (WI-022 -- defense-in-depth, bounds any operator typo or
    automation to the RA's own issuance). Default:
    `WORK-DOMAIN\gMSA-acme-ra$` (placeholder form -- the real value lives in
    gitignored local config). The comparison is case-insensitive and
    locale-independent (the requester value is a SID/name string, not a
    localized column header).

.PARAMETER SkipPublishCrl
    Skip the `certutil -CRL republish` step (use if a scheduled publication is
    imminent or another operator is publishing).

    # Revoke by serial with the RA's details.serial:
    powershell -File .\scripts\Revoke-Cert.ps1 `

# ONLY around the native call; pwsh 7 behaviour is unchanged (there

# Is this serial already revoked in the CA database?

# Locale-independent by the same technique Confirm-SerialAtCa uses and this
# project already trusts: restrict the view and look for the serial VALUE in the
# output rather than parsing a localized column header or status word. The extra
# restriction is `Disposition=21`, ADCS's numeric code for a revoked row (20 is
# issued) -- a number, so no locale enters into it.
#
# Two deliberate safety properties, because this decides whether to skip a
# revocation:
#
#   * `Invoke-CertUtil` is NOT used, because a restriction that matches no rows
#     can exit non-zero and that is a normal answer here, not a fatal error. Any
#     non-zero exit means "could not establish it" and returns $false, so the
#     script falls through to attempting the revoke exactly as it did before.
#   * The Disposition restriction is self-checked. If the serial also comes back
#     under `Disposition=20` (issued), the CA is not honouring the restriction
#     the way this assumes, so its answer is not trusted and the result is
#     $false. Skipping a revocation that was actually needed is the one outcome
#     here that would be worse than the bug being fixed, so it takes a filter
#     that demonstrably discriminates -- not an assumption about certutil's
