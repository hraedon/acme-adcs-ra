.SYNOPSIS
    CA-side pull agent that closes the automated revocation loop (WI-024).

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the headline deliverable of v1.5: it automates the out-of-band
    CA-side revocation step that was previously a manual operator action
    (`scripts/Revoke-Cert.ps1`).

    The loop:
      1. GET <RaBaseUrl>/acme/admin/revocations/pending  (WI-023 endpoint,
         admin-token-gated) -> the RA's "revoked-in-RA-but-active-at-CA" set:
         a list of {serial, req_id, reason, revoked_at}.
      2. For each serial, call `Revoke-Cert.ps1` (which now self-checks the
         requester, WI-022) against the CA. `certutil -revoke -config` is
         remote-capable, so the agent does NOT need to run on the CA -- no
         Kerberos double-hop.
      3. On success, POST <RaBaseUrl>/acme/admin/revocations/<serial>/confirm
         with {"ca_crl_updated": true} so the RA audit flips
         `ca_crl_updated` to true and the serial drops out of the pending
         set on the next pull (idempotent).

    Two deployment topologies are supported:

      - Two-identity (default, recommended): the agent runs as a scheduled
        task on a UTILITY HOST (not the CA) under a dedicated
        `gMSA-acme-revoker$` whose CA-side officer power is template-scoped
        to `ACME-ServerAuth` by the CA's `OfficerRights` restriction
        (WI-025). The enrollment gMSA holds no CA-officer rights -- the
        cardinal invariant holds.

      - Single-identity (opt-in, -LocalMode): the agent runs on the RA host
        under the enrollment gMSA, which is also the revoker. The enrollment
        gMSA must be granted template-scoped OfficerRights on the CA (see
        docs/operations.md ## Single-identity deployment). This is a weaker
        posture (one credential compromise grants both issue and revoke --
        see threat-model section E) but operationally simpler. The invocation
        mechanism is unchanged; -LocalMode signals deployment intent and
        adjusts the mode banner/output.

    Fail-visible, dry-run default. Without -Execute the script is report-only:
    it fetches the pending set and prints what it WOULD do, making no change.
    Pass -Execute to arm it. Every auto-revoke lands in the CA DB (under the
    revoker identity) and the RA audit (via the confirm callback).

    The script is safe to run repeatedly, and repeating it REPAIRS a partial
    run. `Revoke-Cert.ps1` rejects reason 7, and a serial the CA has already
    revoked exits 6 (already revoked, no change made) -- which the agent treats
    as "the CA side is done, retry the RA confirmation" rather than as a
    failure. That is what makes a dropped confirmation callback self-healing:
    before, the retry re-revoked, saw certutil's non-zero already-revoked
    result, booked it as a failure and skipped the callback for ever, so one
    transient network fault desynchronized the RA audit from the CA permanently
    (2026-08-17 F4).

    Exit codes:
      0  = success (all pending serials revoked-and-confirmed, already revoked
           at the CA and confirmed, or dry-run completed, or nothing pending)
      1  = the RA was unreachable or the pending endpoint returned an error
      2  = partial failure (one or more serials failed to revoke or to confirm;
           see the per-serial log lines above)

.PARAMETER RaBaseUrl
    The RA's base URL (e.g. "https://ra.WORK-DOMAIN.local"). The admin
    pending endpoint is at <RaBaseUrl>/acme/admin/revocations/pending.

.PARAMETER AdminToken
    Declare that this run should hold ADMIN authority, drawn from the
    ACME_ADMIN_TOKEN environment variable. This is a SWITCH, not a value:
    since the 2026-08-23 review the script accepts no secret on its command
    line at all -- the invocation is shell history and a process argument
    list, which is exactly where a token should never travel. Set the
    variable first (e.g. `$env:ACME_ADMIN_TOKEN = Read-Host "Admin token"`,
    or load it from the protected dotenv) and pass the bare flag. Fails
    loudly when the flag is given but the variable is unset. Only needed by a
    deployment that has not yet provisioned a confirm token: the RA refuses
    the admin token on the confirm endpoint, so prefer -ConfirmToken.

.PARAMETER ConfirmToken
    Declare that this run should use the revocation CONFIRM credential
    (ACME_CONFIRM_TOKEN), read from that environment variable. A SWITCH, like
    -AdminToken: the value itself is never accepted here. The confirm token
    is the least-privilege credential and the only one the confirm endpoint
    accepts; it alone can power the whole sync workflow. Set the variable
    first and pass the bare flag; the script fails loudly if the flag is
    given while the variable is unset.

.PARAMETER CaConfig
    The CA configuration string ("CA01\WORK-DOMAIN-CA" form). Passed through
    to `Revoke-Cert.ps1` for `certutil -revoke -config`.

.PARAMETER RequesterName
    The expected enrollment identity, passed through to `Revoke-Cert.ps1`'s
    -RequesterName (WI-022 requester check). Default:
    "WORK-DOMAIN\gMSA-acme-ra$" (placeholder form).

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Explicit dry-run: fetch the pending set and print what would be done,
    making no change. This is the default behavior when neither -DryRun nor
    -Execute is given.

.PARAMETER Execute
    Arm the script to actually revoke (call `Revoke-Cert.ps1` and the RA
    confirm callback). Mutually exclusive with -DryRun. Without this switch
    the script is report-only.

.PARAMETER ScriptDir
    Directory containing `Revoke-Cert.ps1`. Default: the same directory as
    this script ($PSScriptRoot).

.PARAMETER LocalMode
    Single-identity deployment: the agent runs on the RA host under the
    enrollment gMSA (which is also the revoker). The enrollment gMSA must
    have template-scoped OfficerRights on the CA (see docs/operations.md
    ## Single-identity deployment). The requester check passes trivially
    since the revoker IS the enrollment gMSA. This flag adjusts the mode
    banner and output; the invocation mechanism is unchanged.

.PARAMETER PublishCrl
    Force an immediate CRL republish after each revocation (passes through by
    NOT setting Revoke-Cert.ps1's -SkipPublishCrl). OFF by default: the default
    is least-privilege -- the revoker/officer identity revokes the cert (which
    the CA records immediately) but does NOT republish the CRL, so the
    revocation becomes visible at the next scheduled CRL publication.
    `certutil -CRL republish` requires the Manage-CA role, so -PublishCrl is
    only usable when the identity has been granted CRL-publish rights. That is
    an explicit operator trade-off: CRL freshness in exchange for a broader
    grant (in the single-identity topology it means the internet-facing
    enrollment identity also holds Manage-CA -- strongly discouraged; more
    defensible for the dedicated two-identity revoker). See threat-model
    section E and docs/operations.md.

.EXAMPLE
    # Dry run (default -- report only, no changes). The credential NEVER
    # travels on the command line: set it in the environment first (any
    # protected source -- the RA dotenv, a vault lookup, an interactive
    # prompt), then run with the bare -ConfirmToken flag:
    $env:ACME_CONFIRM_TOKEN = Read-Host "Revocation confirm token"
    powershell -File .\scripts\Sync-Revocations.ps1 `
        -RaBaseUrl "https://ra.WORK-DOMAIN.local" `
        -CaConfig 'CA01\WORK-DOMAIN-CA' -ConfirmToken

.EXAMPLE
    # Execute (actually revoke pending serials at the CA), same
    # environment-first rule:
    $env:ACME_CONFIRM_TOKEN = Read-Host "Revocation confirm token"
    powershell -File .\scripts\Sync-Revocations.ps1 `
        -RaBaseUrl "https://ra.WORK-DOMAIN.local" `
        -CaConfig 'CA01\WORK-DOMAIN-CA' -ConfirmToken -Execute

.EXAMPLE
    # Single-identity deployment (agent on the RA host under the enrollment
    # gMSA, which is also the revoker):
    $env:ACME_CONFIRM_TOKEN = Read-Host "Revocation confirm token"
    powershell -File .\scripts\Sync-Revocations.ps1 `
        -RaBaseUrl "https://ra.WORK-DOMAIN.local" `
        -CaConfig 'CA01\WORK-DOMAIN-CA' -ConfirmToken -Execute -LocalMode

.NOTES
    Schedule as a Windows Scheduled Task running as `gMSA-acme-revoker$` on
    a utility host with line-of-sight to both the RA (HTTPS) and the CA
    (certutil -config RPC/DCOM). See docs/operations.md ## Automated
    revocation. No signing key, no enrollment -- this is an operator/revoker
    tool only.

    For single-identity deployments, pass -LocalMode and schedule the task
    on the RA host under the enrollment gMSA (which is also the revoker).
    See docs/operations.md ## Single-identity deployment and threat-model
    section E for the explicit trade-off. The invocation mechanism is the same
    either way; -LocalMode signals the deployment topology.
