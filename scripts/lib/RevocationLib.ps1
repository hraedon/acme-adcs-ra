# Dot-sourceable library: revocation reason validation and requester comparison.
# Extracted from Revoke-Cert.ps1 for testability. Used by the Pester tests
# (tests/pester/Revocation.Tests.ps1). The production script keeps its logic
# inline (it is simple enough); this lib validates the same logic independently.

# RFC 5280 section 5.3.1 reason codes. certutil -revoke uses the same numeric
# codes. Two are excluded:
#
#   7 -- "unused" in RFC 5280 (not an RFC 8555 reason); certutil rejects it.
#   8 -- removeFromCRL, the UN-revoke operation. Confirmed against the lab CA
#        during the Plan 004 spike: a certificate placed on hold and then
#        given reason 8 ends up "off the CRL and valid" while ADCS keeps its
#        DB Disposition at 21. A revocation tool must never emit it.
#
# Reason 6 (certificateHold) stays valid: a hold is strictly more restrictive
# than valid, so it cannot be used to undo containment.

# Convert a serial to the form the ADCS CA database stores, so a
# `-restrict "SerialNumber=..."` clause matches exactly.
#
# The RA emits serials via Python's format(n, 'x'), which never produces a
# leading zero. ADCS stores the full byte string, so a certificate whose
# high-order byte is 0x0N is recorded with a leading zero the RA's form lacks
# (e.g. RA "6AB1..." vs CA "06AB1..."). The restrict clause is an exact string
# match, so the lookup would find 0 rows and Revoke-Cert.ps1 would exit 4 --
# fail-safe (nothing wrongly revoked) but it silently stops the automated
# revocation loop for that certificate until someone investigates.
#
# A hex serial derived from bytes always has an even number of digits, so
# re-padding an odd-length value to even reconstructs the CA's form exactly.
# Verified against the lab CA 2026-08-11: 61 issued serials, lengths 32 and 38,
# none currently leading-zero -- this is a latent case, not an observed one.

# 2026-08-16 rescan F2: this used to be an unconditional trailer on
# Revoke-Cert.ps1 ending "...and the CRL is published." That is false on the
# DEFAULT path. Sync-Revocations.ps1 passes -SkipPublishCrl because the
# least-privilege revocation officer cannot republish a CRL (that needs
# Manage-CA), and the batch relays this script's output verbatim -- so the
# containment record showed "Skipping CRL publication" and "the CRL is
# published" for the same certificate, minutes apart. An operator who closes
# containment on the second line leaves relying parties accepting a revoked
# certificate until the next scheduled publication.
#
# Returned as an array of lines so the Pester tests can assert the two branches
# never share a claim.
