.SYNOPSIS
    Register the acme-adcs-ra scheduled maintenance tasks (WI-013).

.DESCRIPTION
    Creates or updates the acme-adcs-ra scheduled maintenance tasks (WI-013).
    By default, two tasks drive the RA's admin maintenance endpoints on a
    cadence (default 15 minutes):

      - acme-adcs-ra-nonce-cleanup        -> DELETE /acme/admin/nonces
      - acme-adcs-ra-expired-order-sweep -> DELETE /acme/admin/expired-orders

    Both endpoints require the admin Bearer token (ACME_RA_ADMIN_TOKEN).
    Since 2026-08-19 F2 the token is NOT written into the task definition:
    the action reads it at run time from the RA's dotenv (-DotEnvPath), which
    the installer ACLs to Administrators/SYSTEM full and the task's gMSA
    read-only. A task definition therefore carries a file path, not a
    credential, and the secret never reaches a process command line. Treat the
    token like an EAB MAC key (see docs/operations.md ## Admin token and
    reclaim runbook).

    Optionally (-RegisterRevocationSync), a third task --
    acme-adcs-ra-sync-revocations -- runs the CA-side revocation pull agent
    (Sync-Revocations.ps1, WI-024) on the same cadence. Unlike the
    nonce/sweep tasks (which call Invoke-RestMethod against an admin
    endpoint), the sync task runs Sync-Revocations.ps1 as a PowerShell
    command with -Execute. Off by default so the two-identity utility-host
    deployment is unaffected.

    The tasks are idempotent: if a task already exists, it is updated in
    place (Unregister + Register). Use -WhatIf to preview the actions
    without registering anything.

.PARAMETER BaseUrl
    The RA's public base URL (e.g. "https://acme-ra.WORK-DOMAIN.local/").
    Must match ACME_RA_BASE_URL -- the admin endpoints are under /acme/admin/.

.PARAMETER AdminToken
    Declare that this host's tasks should hold ADMIN authority. This is a
    SWITCH, not a value: since the Daybreak 2026-08-15 review the script
    accepts no secret on its command line at all -- the registration command
    is shell history and a process argument list, which is exactly where a
    one-time-pasted token should never travel. The task action loads
    ACME_RA_ADMIN_TOKEN from -DotEnvPath at RUN TIME; the value must already
    be present there. Required (as a flag) when registering the general
    nonce/sweep tasks; omit it entirely on a dedicated revocation host.

.PARAMETER ConfirmToken
    Declare that the revocation-sync task should load the revocation
    CONFIRM credential (ACME_RA_REVOCATION_CONFIRM_TOKEN) from -DotEnvPath at
    run time. A SWITCH, like -AdminToken: the value itself is never accepted
    here. The confirm token is the least-privilege credential and the only
    one the confirm endpoint accepts; preferred over -AdminToken for the sync
    task. The value must already be present in the dotenv.

.PARAMETER IntervalMinutes
    Cadence in minutes for both tasks (default 15).

.PARAMETER TaskUser
    The account the tasks run as. Default is the gMSA
    ("WORK-DOMAIN\gMSA-acme-ra$") so the task can read acme-ra.env if needed
    and has no more privilege than the RA itself. Alternatively pass
    "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" or a dedicated service account.

.PARAMETER TaskFolder
    Optional scheduled-task folder (default "\acme-adcs-ra\"). Must start
    and end with a backslash.

.PARAMETER RegisterRevocationSync
    Also register the acme-adcs-ra-sync-revocations task, which runs
    Sync-Revocations.ps1 (the CA-side revocation pull agent, WI-024) on the
    same cadence. Requires -CaConfig. Off by default so the two-identity
    utility-host deployment (where the sync task is registered separately on
    the utility host) is unaffected.

.PARAMETER CaConfig
    The CA configuration string ("CA01\WORK-DOMAIN-CA" form). Required when
    -RegisterRevocationSync is set; passed through to Sync-Revocations.ps1
    (and onward to Revoke-Cert.ps1 / certutil -revoke -config). Ignored
    when -RegisterRevocationSync is not set.

.PARAMETER RequesterName
    The expected enrollment identity, passed through to Sync-Revocations.ps1's
    -RequesterName (the WI-022 requester check in Revoke-Cert.ps1). Must be the
    real DOMAIN\account under which the RA enrolls (as recorded in the CA DB
    Requester column), e.g. "CONTOSO\gMSA-acme-ra$". Defaults to the committed
    placeholder "WORK-DOMAIN\gMSA-acme-ra$" -- override it, or the requester
    check refuses every revoke ("Requester mismatch"). Only meaningful with
    -RegisterRevocationSync.

.PARAMETER PublishCrl
    Passed through to Sync-Revocations.ps1 as -PublishCrl: force an immediate
    CRL republish after each revocation. OFF by default (least-privilege: the
    revocation is recorded at the CA and appears at the next scheduled CRL
    publication). Enabling it requires the task identity to hold Manage-CA
    (CRL-publish) rights -- an explicit operator trade-off. See
    Sync-Revocations.ps1 .PARAMETER PublishCrl and threat-model section E.
    Only meaningful with -RegisterRevocationSync.

.PARAMETER LocalMode
    Passed through to Sync-Revocations.ps1 as -LocalMode, signalling
    single-identity deployment (agent on the RA host under the enrollment
    gMSA, which is also the revoker). Only meaningful with
    -RegisterRevocationSync. See Sync-Revocations.ps1 .PARAMETER LocalMode
    and docs/operations.md ## Single-identity deployment.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Register the revocation-sync task in report-only mode: the task action
    passes -DryRun (not -Execute) to Sync-Revocations.ps1, so it fetches the
    pending set and prints what it would do without making any change. Use
    this for the dry-run -> execute promotion path (see docs/operations.md
    ## Dry-run -> execute promotion). Re-register without -DryRun to arm the
    task. Only meaningful with -RegisterRevocationSync.

.PARAMETER AllowUntrustedScriptPath
    Register the revocation-sync task even when this script tree, or a
    directory above it, can be written by a non-administrator. The task
    executes Sync-Revocations.ps1 from this tree as the task identity on
    every run, so a writable tree means whoever can write it decides what
    runs privileged. Measured on the lab host 2026-08-17: the staged tree
    C:\Temp\ra-scripts carried BUILTIN\Users:(I)(CI)(AD) and (I)(CI)(WD)
    inherited from C:\Temp. Use only to reproduce a known-untrusted staging
    path, never for a pilot or production registration.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Dry run: print the actions that would be taken without registering
    anything.

.EXAMPLE
    # Register both tasks as the gMSA on a 15-minute cadence. Note: -AdminToken
    # is a FLAG -- the value lives in the dotenv, never on a command line:
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Register-MaintenanceTasks.ps1 `
        -BaseUrl "https://acme-ra.WORK-DOMAIN.local" `
        -AdminToken `
        -IntervalMinutes 15 `
        -TaskUser "WORK-DOMAIN\gMSA-acme-ra$"

.EXAMPLE
    # Dry run (does not register anything):
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Register-MaintenanceTasks.ps1 `
        -BaseUrl "https://acme-ra.WORK-DOMAIN.local" `
        -AdminToken -WhatIf

.EXAMPLE
    # Single-identity deployment: also register the revocation-sync task on
    # the RA host under the enrollment gMSA (which is also the revoker):
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Register-MaintenanceTasks.ps1 `
        -BaseUrl "https://acme-ra.WORK-DOMAIN.local" `
        -AdminToken -ConfirmToken `
        -IntervalMinutes 15 `
        -TaskUser "WORK-DOMAIN\gMSA-acme-ra$" `
        -RegisterRevocationSync -CaConfig 'CA01\WORK-DOMAIN-CA' -LocalMode

.NOTES
    Run elevated (local Administrator). Requires the ScheduledTasks module
    (built into Windows Server). See docs/operations.md ## Scheduled
    maintenance tasks. No signing key, no enrollment -- this is an operator
    admin tool only.
