"""Standard whole-repository scan of `a566050` — three medium findings.

All three are the same family the previous rounds keep producing: a control
that already exists, with its reasoning already written down, not pointed at
one more call site. Two are audit-growth bounds; one is the post-issuance
orphan path, which is the one that can leave a domain-trusted certificate
outside the RA entirely.

* **F1 (the one that matters).** ``Store.record_issuance`` is the FIRST durable
  record of something ADCS has already done, and it was unguarded. On a full or
  read-only database the certificate/order/audit transaction rolls back, the
  exception escapes before the SIEM fan-out, and a live certificate exists with
  no row, no audit event, no quarantine record and no revocation queue entry.
  Both neighbouring paths — verifier rejection and transport failure — already
  had orphan handlers; the SUCCESS path did not. Neither of those handlers
  would have helped anyway: both fall back to ``_audit``, which is the same
  database that just failed.

* **F2.** ``finalize-enrollment-admission-denied`` was not coalesced. The gate
  sheds at ``adcs_enrollment_max_pending`` and the route CAS-restores the order
  to ``ready``, so the identical signed finalize can be replayed for as long as
  capacity stays full — one durable row apiece. This is the same sentence the
  coalescer's own docstring already wrote for ``order-rate-limited``.

* **F3.** The revocation-confirm credential could POST nonexistent serials
  forever (``admin-revocation-confirm-denied``), and every poll of the pending
  list wrote a row. The second half is not really an attack: the sync task
  polls on a fixed interval forever, so that table grows without bound in
  entirely benign operation, and this deployment refuses audit pruning.

Every test below is mutation-checked; the mutation that breaks each one is
named in its docstring. A test that cannot fail against the pre-fix code is not
evidence.
