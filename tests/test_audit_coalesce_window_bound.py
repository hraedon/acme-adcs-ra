"""The coalescer's in-memory window index is bounded, not just its rows.

Round-7 pre-Daybreak review. The 2026-08-15 rescan-2 fix made *durable* audit
growth a function of elapsed time: repeated denials of the same kind update a
row that is already committed, so ten thousand attempts cost a handful of rows.
Nothing, however, bounded the dictionary that tracks which windows are open.

A key was dropped only when that same key was recorded again after its window
had lapsed, and no sweep ever ran. For account-creation denials that is
harmless — the key is (event type x server-chosen reason), a small fixed set.
The round-5 additions changed the shape: ``finalize-csr-mismatch`` and
``finalize-policy-denied`` put ``order_id`` in the key, so a client that
finalizes many orders badly mints a fresh key each time and none is ever
collected. The installer configures the app pool with ``idleTimeout=00:00:00``
and ``recycling.periodicRestart.time=00:00:00``, so the worker process does not
recycle and reclaim it either.

Every test names the mutation that breaks it.
