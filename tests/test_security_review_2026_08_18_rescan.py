"""Regression tests for the 2026-08-18 rescan of `d26b892`.

Two findings, both defects introduced by the 2026-08-18 fixes themselves:

* F1 (medium) — the legacy JWK canonicalization migration mutated rows before it
  had resolved collisions, so a database holding one key under two encodings
  either crashed startup with an uncaught `IntegrityError` or came up serving
  both rows — preserving the very deactivation bypass the migration existed to
  remove.
* F2 (low) — the CRL redirect origin check accepted the target scheme's default
  port as an alternative to the configured one (so `:8080` → `:80` passed), and
  compared hostname text without binding the resolved address.

Each test here was mutation-checked: the fix was reverted in turn and the test
confirmed to fail. See docs/security-review-2026-08-18-rescan.md.
