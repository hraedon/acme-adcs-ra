"""Regression tests for the enrollment lease (2026-08-15 rescan, DIFF-RECLAIM-001).

The rescan of the 2026-08-15 hardening branch found that the ``ActiveEnrollments``
mark was *nested inside the worker*: it was taken after the ``ready``→``processing``
CAS and after the threadpool hand-off, and released before the certificate row was
written. Two gaps followed, and in both of them a reclaim could truthfully observe
"no live worker, no certificate" and reopen the order for a second CA issuance:

1. **The queue gap.** A finalize whose task is still queued behind a saturated
   threadpool has already committed the order to ``processing`` but is invisible
   to the registry. Past the reclaim age floor an operator can verify at the CA
   that nothing was issued, reclaim to ``ready``, and a second finalize can take
   the order — after which *both* the stale queued task and the new one submit
   the same order to ADCS.
2. **The completion gap.** The mark ended when the worker returned, before
   ``_finalize_complete`` wrote the certificate row.

The fix has two halves and this file pins both:

* the mark is taken in the *route*, around the CAS, the hand-off and the
  completion, so no part of the in-flight interval is unmarked (tests A, B); and
* a durable ``processing_generation`` lease in the store, re-checked immediately
  before the CA is touched, so a stale task cannot submit even if the
  process-local mark is wrong or absent (tests C onward).

Every test here was mutation-checked: the corresponding fix was reverted in turn
and the test confirmed to fail. See docs/security-review-2026-08-15-rescan.md.
