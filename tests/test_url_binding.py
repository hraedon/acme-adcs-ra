"""Regression tests: JWS/EAB URL binding must pin to the configured base_url.

The 2026-08-11 review found that `_verify_url` and the EAB `expected_url` were
both derived from `request.url` — which is built from the client-supplied
`Host` header (and, behind a proxy, `X-Forwarded-Proto`). Comparing the
protected-header url to the request url therefore only proved the client was
consistent with itself: an EAB minted for a *different* RA deployment verified
here, defeating the cross-endpoint replay control added on 2026-08-07.

**Test design note.** These tests deliberately configure ``base_url`` to a
value that differs from the host the test transport uses. That is not an
artificial contortion — it is the production shape (``base_url`` is the public
name; the request reaches the worker over loopback with whatever ``Host`` and
scheme the proxy passed through). It is also what makes the tests meaningful:
when ``base_url`` matches the transport host, ``str(request.url)`` and the
config-derived URL are the same string, so a test written that way passes
identically against the vulnerable and the fixed code.
