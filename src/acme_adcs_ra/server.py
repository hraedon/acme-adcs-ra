"""FastAPI ACME server (RFC 8555 subset) for the ADCS Registration Authority.

This module is the composition root — it wires the app, includes routers,
and sets up the exception handler. Route logic lives in routes/, shared
state in app_state.py, finalize helpers in finalize.py, CSR validation in
csr_validation.py, and JSON serializers in serializers.py.

This module only **verifies** JWS signatures and CSRs; it never signs anything.
The enrollment leg (``EnrollmentLeg``) forwards accepted CSRs to ADCS.
