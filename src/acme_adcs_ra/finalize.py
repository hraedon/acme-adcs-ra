    ADCS has already issued by the time ``record_issuance`` runs, and that call
    is the FIRST durable record of the fact. If it raises -- a full disk, a
    read-only database, a corrupt file -- the whole certificate/order/audit
    transaction rolls back and the certificate is live at the CA with no row,
    no audit event, no quarantine record and no revocation queue entry.

    ``audit_retention`` states the invariant this protects: *"the
    certificate-issued audit row commits in the same transaction as the
    certificate, so a full disk stops issuance rather than issuing unaudited."*
    That holds only while the disk fills BEFORE the CA call. In the window
    between "ADCS committed" and "SQLite committed" it cannot hold, because the
    issuance has already happened and no local rollback can undo it. This is
    the compensation for that window.

    **Nothing here touches the store.** That is the whole point, and it is why
    the two neighbouring handlers are not reused: ``_quarantine_and_fail`` and
    ``_quarantine_transport_orphan`` both fall back to ``_audit``, which is
    ``Store.record_audit`` -- the same database that just failed. Under the
    fault this function exists for, that fallback raises from inside its own
    except block and no evidence is written anywhere.

    Two sinks, both independent of SQLite:

    * ``logger.critical`` -- goes to the RA's own log file, which is on a
      DIFFERENT path from the database and, on the supported deployment, is
      also what the Windows Event Log collector reads.
    * ``ctx.audit_hook`` -- called DIRECTLY with a hand-built event rather than
      through ``emit_audit_hook``'s usual after-the-row-commits contract,
      because there is no row and there is not going to be one. When
      ``audit_offbox_required`` is set this is a live off-box collector and the
      evidence leaves the host.

    Neither sink is trusted to succeed. The hook is wrapped because a SIEM
    transport error must not replace the exception the caller is about to
    re-raise, and because logging handlers swallow transport errors anyway --
    so a delivered-looking emission is not proof of delivery.
