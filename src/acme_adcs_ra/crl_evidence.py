"""Independent CRL evidence for CA-side revocation confirmations.

The RA holds no CA rights, so it cannot ask the CA "did you revoke this?".
That is why the WI-024 confirmation callback exists: the CA-side pull agent
runs ``certutil -revoke`` and then tells the RA it succeeded. The RA used to
take that entirely on faith and write ``revocation-ca-confirmed`` — an audit
event asserting an external security event it had not observed.

There is exactly one check available to the RA that does **not** depend on the
calling agent's honesty: the CRL. It is published by the CA, signed by the CA's
own key, and readable without any privilege. If a serial appears on a validly
signed CRL, the certificate really is revoked, no matter what the agent claims.

This module fetches and verifies that evidence. It is deliberately strict:

* the CRL's signature is verified against the **issuing CA certificate taken
  from the certificate's own stored chain** — not against whatever the CRL
  claims about itself, and not against a separately configured trust anchor
  that could drift from the chain the certificate was actually issued under;
* freshness is checked independently of the signature, because a signed CRL
  stays cryptographically valid for ever: ``nextUpdate`` must be present and
  in the future, ``thisUpdate`` must not be in the future, and the document
  must be within an absolute age ceiling. A replayed pre-revocation CRL is
  exactly what an attacker suppressing a revocation would like the RA to keep
  accepting, and ``nextUpdate`` alone is under the CA's control;
* every failure returns "no evidence" rather than raising, so the caller
  decides whether missing evidence is fatal (``require_crl_evidence``) or
  merely downgrades the audit record to ``agent-asserted``.

    Never raises: any failure is reported as ``checked=False`` with a reason.

    ``timeout_seconds`` is what ``requests`` understands: a bound on the
    connect and on each individual socket read. ``total_timeout_seconds`` is
    the wall-clock bound on the whole retrieval, and it is the one that
    matters for availability — a server that emits one byte just before every
    read timeout never trips the per-read bound and can hold the calling
    worker indefinitely (2026-08-16 rescan F4).

    ``follow_redirects`` defaults to **False** (2026-08-18 rescan F2). Every
    redirect is a destination chosen by whoever answers the configured CDP, and
    a CDP that redirects at all is unusual — so the default removes the hop
    rather than policing it. Enabled, hops are held to the configured origin:
    same host, same port (bar one documented http:80 → https:443 upgrade), and
    the host must keep resolving inside the address set seen at the start.

    ``watermark`` is the newest CRL this RA has already acted on for the same
    issuing CA. Supplied, a document that goes *backwards* from it is refused
    as ``crl-evidence-regressed`` rather than believed (UNFILED item 23). This
    is the control that actually defends against replay, and the age ceiling
    never was: a stale CRL that *lacks* the serial already fails closed, so the
    only wrong-*accept* an old CRL can produce is a hold->unhold replay — a
    certificate revoked with reason 6 and later released with reason 8
    (``removeFromCRL``) is still listed as revoked on the older document.

    ``enforce_monotonic=False`` computes and reports the verdict but does not
    refuse on it. That is for an estate whose CDP replicas are known to lag:
    the watermark still advances and the regression is still visible in the
    audit trail, so the operator gets the measurement without the refusal.

    """Run CRL evidence fetches off the shared enrollment worker pool.

    Two separate problems, one owner (2026-08-16 rescan F4):

    *Pool isolation.* ``run_in_threadpool`` hands work to AnyIO's default
    thread limiter — the same finite set of tokens that ``finalize`` uses for
    the synchronous ADCS enrollment call. CRL retrieval is an outbound fetch
    of an operator-configured URL whose duration a third party influences, so
    letting it draw from that pool means a slow CRL host can queue issuance
    behind it. This gate owns a small dedicated executor instead: a stalled
    CRL can exhaust *this* pool, and issuance is unaffected.

    *Single flight.* Confirmations are idempotent but the idempotence check
    (``ca_crl_updated``) only helps once a reconciliation has committed, so N
    concurrent confirmations for one serial all passed the check and all
    fetched. Concurrent callers for the same key now share one retrieval, and
    a flood of confirmations for a single serial costs exactly one fetch.

    *Admission control* (2026-08-17 F3). ``max_workers`` bounds how many
    retrievals *run*, not how many are accepted. ``ThreadPoolExecutor``'s work
    queue is an unbounded ``SimpleQueue``, and every waiting caller also
    retains a suspended request task, so distinct keys arriving faster than
    they complete grow both without limit. ``max_pending`` is the ceiling on
    distinct flights in progress; past it, :meth:`run` raises
    :class:`CrlEvidenceGateBusy` and the caller sheds the request instead of
    queueing it. Callers joining an *existing* flight are never rejected —
    they cost nothing new.

    Cancellation-safe: a caller that disconnects does not cancel the shared
    retrieval out from under the callers still waiting on it.

        future settles, while the awaiting caller resumes as soon as it settles.
        So a caller that has just awaited its own retrieval can still observe it
        counted here. That lag flaked CI on Windows, where the loop happens to
