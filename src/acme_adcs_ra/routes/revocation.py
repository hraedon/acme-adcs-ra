    #       `Revoke-Cert.ps1` would fail on the recorded reason (M-1).

    #       `certutil -revoke <serial> 8` verbatim through the pending list and

    #       successful revocation in the RA — 410 on the certificate, order

    #       call asked to *undo* a revocation rather than perform one. Plan 004
    #       confirmed the effect against the lab CA: a held certificate given
    #       reason 8 ends up "off the CRL and valid". The owner is told the
