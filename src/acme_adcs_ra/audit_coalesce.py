"""Time-windowed coalescing of account-creation denial audit rows.

Daybreak 2026-08-15 second rescan, F4 (the standing WI-014), part two.

The finding, restated: an allowlisted peer needs no account and no valid EAB
secret to make the RA write a durable audit row. It generates its own account
key, fetches a nonce, sends a ``newAccount`` whose EAB will not verify, and one
SQLite row plus one appended JSONL record land on the issuance host's disk. Per
request. Forever.

Three previous waves declined to fix this, and their reason was right: the
remediation people usually reach for is a *pruner*, and deleting audit evidence
is precisely the operation an attacker wants. Trading a disk-space problem for
a missing-evidence problem is not a fix.

So this is not a pruner. Nothing is ever deleted, and no denial goes
unrecorded. Within a window, repeats of the same *kind* of denial are folded
into the row that is already on disk:

* The first denial of a kind opens a window and writes a normal audit row.
* Every later denial of that kind inside the window **updates that row in
  place** — bumping ``denial_count``, moving ``last_seen``, and adding the
  offered ``kid`` to a bounded set of digests.
* The next denial after the window has elapsed opens a fresh row, which also
  carries the closed window's final tally in ``previous_window``.

Durable growth therefore becomes a function of *time* — at most one row per
(reason x window) — rather than of the attacker's request rate, while the count
of attempts stays exact. Because the counter is updated on a row that is
already committed, even a hard crash cannot lose it.

That bound holds while the number of distinct keys live in a window stays under
``MAX_OPEN_WINDOWS``. **Above it the bound degrades back toward one row per
request**, because round-robin across more keys than the index can hold makes
every lookup a miss. At shipped defaults this is out of reach — it needs >1024
live ``finalize`` keys inside one 60s window against a 50-orders/hour/kid limit
— but an operator who sets ``rate_limit_orders_per_window=0`` (documented as a
supported "rely on the reverse proxy" mode) removes the thing keeping it out of
reach, and a LONGER coalesce window makes it easier rather than harder, because
keys stay resident. ``coalescer_evictions`` on the rows is the signal.

The in-memory index of open windows is separately capped (``MAX_OPEN_WINDOWS``).
Bounding the durable rows says nothing about the dictionary that tracks them,
and the round-5 keys carry an ``order_id``, so distinct keys accrue with orders
in a worker process the installer configures never to recycle.

The coalescing key deliberately excludes the ``kid`` and the requester. Both
are attacker-chosen; keying on them would let a peer defeat the bound by
varying one character per request. The distinct kids seen in a window are
recorded as digests instead, bounded in number and counted in full. For the
replayable *authenticated* classes added in Daybreak round 5, the key carries
the account and order ids (not attacker-chosen per request): one account's
replay storm folds, different accounts stay separable, and the row's own
``account_id``/``order_id`` columns keep the folded tally attributable.

# Which denials are coalesced, and why exactly these.
#
# Account-creation denials (``account-creation-denied``): an allowlisted peer
# needs no account and, for most paths, no valid EAB secret to make the RA write
# a durable audit row. The lifetime EAB account-quota denial is also folded
# here: it has no account id and a valid client can replay it indefinitely.
#
# Replayable authenticated denials (Daybreak round 5): a *valid* credential
# replayed at line rate could grow the durable stores without bound even
# though every request is individually accountable -- accountability does not
# bound disk. These classes are replayable because each one can be re-sent
# indefinitely against unchanged server state, costing the attacker nothing:
#
# * ``account-request-denied`` -- a deactivated or EAB-evicted account key
#   still authenticates the JWS; the denial is the point.
# * ``order-rate-limited`` / ``key-change-rate-limited`` -- requests rejected
#   *because* they exceed a cap are unbounded by definition: the limiter does
#   not throttle the audit row. (14a: the keyChange ceiling would otherwise
#   just move the growth from the success row to the denial row.)
# * ``finalize-csr-mismatch`` / ``finalize-policy-denied`` -- cheap pre-enrollment
#   validation failures on an order that stays ``ready``, so the identical
#   failing finalize can be replayed forever.
#
# Everything else -- issuance, revocation, admin action, one-time state
# transitions -- keeps one row per event, unconditionally. In particular the
# SUCCESSFUL ``account-key-changed`` row is never coalesced: it is both the
# only record naming the new key's thumbprint and the counter the 14a limiter
# reads.

# (event type x server-chosen reason). For the replayable authenticated classes
# added in round 5 the key also carries ``order_id``, so a client that finalizes
# many orders badly mints a new, never-collected key each time -- and the

        There is nothing to flush: each window's tally was written to its row
        on every increment, so the durable counts are already exact. This only
        clears process state, so a long-lived window cannot outlive the run it
        was measuring.
